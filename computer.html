                     Founded on March 5th, 2003, LinkedIn is a social media site for business networking (Di Gangi and Wasko, 2016). By the end of 2013, the website had 184 million visitors worldwide and 65.6 million visitors from the US. It is available in 24 languages (Di Gangi and Wasko, 2016).
Employing a sort of self-service, businesses create LinkedIn advertising through this social media channel in order to reach the professional demographic they choose as their target market (Guo, Z. Liu and Y. Liu, 2016). Having a credit card and a LinkedIn account are the two prerequisites for starting LinkedIn ads. LinkedIn provides a wide range of adverts through its websites, including self-servicing PPC, slide sharing, sponsored IN mails, LinkedIn group, and spotlights ads (Di Gangi and Wasko, 2016).

                     For instance, Sponsored In mail adverts are a form of personalized message that is sent to the inbox of significant users of LinkedIn. The key benefit of employing a sponsored IN mail is that advertisers may pick and target particular audiences.
Marketers can now analyze advertising effectiveness effectively thanks to LinkedInâ€™s recent implementation of lead accelerator and new Network Display in February 2016. Lead accelerator gives marketers the ability to pitch products based on properly segmented customers using their login data. In Network Display, the advertiser uses login information and profile identifiers to target people who are not already on this social networking platform (Di Gangi and Wasko, 2016). LinkedIn and AppNexus joined together in order for LinkedIn to have access to a variety of websites operated by third parties and to better target potential LinkedIn users (Di Gangi and Wasko, 2016).

                     Social media follows the 4Cs concept, which stands for content, collaboration, community, and collective intelligence. These four elements specify the useability and reach of social media networks (Di Gangi and Wasko, 2016). Given that so many professionals worldwide utilize LinkedIn, it has been observed that the visibility of content there is very high (Aggarwal, 2016). LinkedIn users may generate leads and raise brand awareness for their businesses. Marketers use the platform to draw in the professional community and it has established itself as a powerful instrument for advertising-based promotion. Researchers performed a poll to find out how satisfied LinkedIn users were with the service, and they discovered that 53% of Atlantic residents and 49% of British Columbia residents agreed with the statement. As a result, using LinkedIn to reach customers offers a positive customer experience. For their services and products, approximately 91% of business-to-business advertisers chose LinkedIn, followed by Twitter and Facebook. Compared to Facebook and Twitter, where 35% of users visit daily, 32% occasionally, and 16% rarely, LinkedIn has a user base of 61% (Wang, 2016).
