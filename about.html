                     <h2>Ladder of Engagement</h2>
                     <p> The phrase “ladder of engagement” is a systematic strategy that
                         any business can adopt to involve people in the various stages
                          of marketing and financial performance (Gallagher, 2016). 
                          According to Quinton and Wilson (2016), companies that recognize 
                          and ensure greater consumer impact than their rivals are more
                           successful in the current competitive market and are able to 
                           develop stronger brands. A brand’s affinity—the sentiment and
                            impression a consumer has toward a product or service—is 
                            something that organizations must ensure they
                             understand clearly. Due to the fact that sales and
                              affinity are interconnected (Jackson and Ahuja, 2016).
                               Finding out how committed a customer is to a certain 
                               brand may be done with the use of the ladder of engagement.
                                The lowest rungs of the ladder enable prospective buyers to connect
                                 with the brand by rating and evaluating products and taking part in 
                                 a variety of discussions about a wide range of goods and services. 
                                 A customer at the top of the customer ladder encourages other users
                                  to collaborate with them in the creation of content for the business
                                   by engaging in direct promotion. </p>
                           <p>
                              Amazon is a great example of a business that uses this concept in a highly strategic way to sell their brand. To start, it’s important to note that e-marketing is currently experiencing a tremendous increase in popularity, and Amazon is widely recognized as the market leader in this area. The idea of moving up the involvement ladder is prevalent across the organization. In order to more successfully serve their customer base, a corporation may adhere to a Collaborative Co-creation component, claim Moreno, Calderón, and Moreno (2016). After purchasing any goods, this step of the procedure enables each user to leave ratings and reviews. All of these are on display for others to view, and they can base their own purchasing choices on the opinions of other consumers. It is simpler to persuade others to join this system due to the high level of transparency. Additionally, it helps the company create a more favorable brand perception among the clients it serves. 
                           </p> 
                           <p>
                              Customers can ask questions on the internet, and the business will respond as completely as it can. In order to increase their social advertising, Amazon routinely reaches out to their customers on a wide range of social media platforms. These websites offer a platform where users may exchange opinions and talk with one another about various goods and services. Additionally, Amazon advertises a number of discount deals on their website to draw attention to their existence. To increase the reach of this content, the company depends on the emails from the cherished customers and their sporadic information sharing (Smith and Barrett, 2016). People routinely post exciting bargains that a company is doing on social media, which not only promotes the company but also broadens its reach. By responding to numerous messages left on its website, Amazon increases the level of connection with its users, which allows the company to enhance their brand image in a variety of ways (Chen, Jaw and Wu, 2016).
