                     <h2>Trend Analysis</h2>
                     <p> In general, trend analysis increases each organization’s competitive advantage over its rivals. Trend analysis, according to Go and You (2016), is a method of gathering data and looking for any specific pattern or trend related to the flow of information, consumer behavior, and industry performance. Here, the emphasis is primarily on the digital trend and how it benefits any brand in order to strengthen its position in a cutthroat market.
                        Online marketing has recently become extremely popular both in developed and developing countries. Numerous businesses in the e-marketing sector are focusing on digital marketing to increase their online presence and streamline the customer experience (De Corniere and De Nijs, 2016). Wang (2016) asserts that mobile apps are the best possible trend for an e-marketing company out of all the available digital marketing trends. The best alternative for the e-commerce business is mobile apps. This can be used effectively by businesses to update their customers on a regular basis and to request updates from the market regarding their products and services. This is one of the most recent trends that has completely altered how business has been conducted in recent years (Wang, 2016).
                         </p>
                           <p>
                              Simply put, creating a mobile app is crucial for any e-commerce business for the reasons listed below: <br>
                              •	The use of smartphones has significantly increased over the past few years because most people prefer to use their phones to select from a variety of products that are available on e-commerce websites because they are convenient. <br>
                              •	For businesses to ensure greater customer loyalty, using mobile apps for marketing is more beneficial. Many businesses (especially those in e-commerce) frequently prefer to advertise special discounts to draw in more customers (Wang, 2016). <br>
                              •	The main benefit of this digital trend is that users can conveniently access the application from any location at any time. Therefore, an easy-to-use mobile phone is a great option for businesses like Amazon to reach out to more customers. <br>
                              As one of the top online retailers, Amazon now offers more than nine million books and 130000 products from more than 100 different brands (Saxsena, 2013). The introduction of a mobile application has allowed the business to better serve its customers by providing them with access to goods and services whenever it suits them. Additionally, Amazon has been able to distinguish itself from a wide range of rivals, including e-bay, who have also embraced mobile applications to better serve their customers (Saxsena, 2013).
                              
                           </p>

                              <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                         
                              The use of digital media platforms such as LinkedIn is successful in fostering relationships with existing customers as well as prospective ones. E-commerce company Amazon has been successful in growing both its sales and its visibility by focusing on the design of its website and by implementing a methodology known as the "ladder of engagement." Accessibility, identity, navigation, and content are the primary components of the web checklist that are required for any company to create a webpage. These elements have been compared and analyzed using the Amazon webpage as an example. Newspapers as a medium have also gone through a metamorphosis, and now companies like Marketers can advertise their products and services in digital newspapers. As a result, marketers need to make an effort to communicate and relate their product through the use of digital platforms, as the potential for future growth are considerable.
